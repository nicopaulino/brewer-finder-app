# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

In order to properly run this app, you must first npm install. 

This will install all necessary dependencies. 

Next, you must get an API ket for [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

Once you have a working API key, creat a .env file and place your key in the file. This app will be looking for the key using the variable REACT_APP_API_KEY. 

Once you have done all of this, the app should run with no issues. 

Final notes about this coding challenge: 

I had a lot of fun working on this coding challenge, I decided to go with something simple for the design. I thought it best to use Boostrap's accordion so I could have all of my data on simple page. If you dive through the code, you will see steps were made to add a backend server and database, however due to time constraints I was unable to finish these features. I plan on continuing to work on these features and fully implementing them into my project. 

Thank you :)
